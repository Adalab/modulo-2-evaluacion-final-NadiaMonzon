## Functionality of the page

I present a website where you can search for your favorite anime series.
You will find a text input where you will have to type the anime you want to search for. Next to it we have the "Search" button, which we will have to click to get different results.
Two columns will appear, one of your favorite anime and the other of the anime found according to what you have written. The anime you click in the "Search results" column will be marked with a pink background color and the title will be in italics, also, they will go in their original state to the "Your favorite anime" column and will be saved in the Local Storage.
Last but not least, we have a button that will delete the content of favorites and cache saved by the browser.

## Technologies used

To layout the static elements of the page we have used HTML and styled it with CSS. The dynamic elements - such as the "Your favorite anime" and "Search results" sections - have been mapped from JavaScript.
We have linked the [API](https://api.jikan.moe/v4/anime?q=) to show the different animes and their respective data that the application has.
We have implemented all this through VS Code.
